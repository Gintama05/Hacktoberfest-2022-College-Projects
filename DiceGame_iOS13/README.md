# Random Dice Project

## Goal

The objective is to make a simple iOS application which will generate random dice numbers on clicking the roll button.

## What is Created

I have made a Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button or by shaking your phone. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be fully set up to settle any score on the go!

## Requirements

To run this project in the Xcode simulator. You will have to define your own bundle identifier, organization, etc. You will have to create a new project in which you can just use this code. Other requirements will be satisfied by Xcode. You may or may not use the assets like images and logos and create your own. Thats it!
